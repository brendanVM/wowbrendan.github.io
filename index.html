<h3>Youtube, Twitch and the phenomenon of streaming and watching video games.<small>12/8/2015</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="img/enlarge.png">
<p>Games and Human nature at its core is a <strong>social experience.</strong> People crave and need social interaction in order to thrive and be sucessful. Throughout my lifetime I have experienced 4 major shifts in how technology has shaped how I approach communitcating with the world around me. There are countless articles critiquing Milienials, and how we use technology to socialize and interact with the world around us. When really our parents and grandparents are just as hooked on social media as we are.</p>

<p><strong>twitch.tv</strong><br>
100+ million unique viewers per month<br>
1.7+ million unique broadcasters per month<br>
12,000+ members of the Twitch Partner Program<br>
106 minutes watched per person per day<br>
2+ million peak concurrent sitewide viewers</p>

<img class="thumbnail" src="img/watch.png">

<p>This rivals modern television shows and youtube which has around 1 billion unique viewers per month. 10% of people who have used youtube have used twitch. Both of these services provide a platform for people who play and watch games to share opinions, show off skill and generally get together to have fun.</P>

<p>Games are seen by some as an escape from reality, when really this medium is a more in depth story telling tool. A more complex game of chess or strategy. An excercise for the mind. While longer periods of time are needed to really get into the medium, it is really no different than binging television or reading for hours. The difference is that these games require input from the players which does require good hand eye coordination and going further, good descision making skills, paitence and teamwork.</p>

<p>This is the future and there is no stopping it. Maybe the bubble of how much money is being made will burst, but even if that happens gamers will still find part time jobs and find a way to do what they love. Developers are raking in more money than ever so it is clear that games and interactive media are here to stay. So how do we get the older generations to understand what gaming is like for millenials? They can relate to pac-man and mario but have no concept of what the online social landscape looks like today.</p>

<p>I have a theory that as internet infrastructure has expanded and computing power has become more efficient, we now have the ability to create and consume more content than ever before. In 2008 videos and entertainment surrounding games consisted of 10 minute or less youtube montages. Then players like Hutch started recording gameplay and commentating over the footage. This lead to a huge wave of gamers wanting to become famous for skill or their personal reactions to games and media. Now with services like twitch we can follow these players for the whole play session. It is like the younger sibling watching their older siblings beat games that they do not have the skill to play.</p>
